# Program Title PONG

Objective

Pong is a two-dimensional sports game that simulates table tennis. The player controls an in-game paddle by moving it vertically across the left or right side of the screen. They can compete against another player controlling a second paddle on the opposing side. Players use the paddles to hit a ball back and forth.

Mechanics

Mouse will be needed to start the game as well as your up and down arrow during the game. The up and down arrow will determine whether the board moves. 

Scoring

Scoring is tallied on if the ball hits the "net", which is basically the back wall of your opponent. The score is up to 11 and can be played as many times as you want
