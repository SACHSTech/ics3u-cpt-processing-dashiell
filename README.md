HANG MAN


Objective

Hangman is a paper and pencil guessing game for two or more players. One player thinks of a word, phrase or sentence and the other(s) tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

Mechanics

Mouse will be needed to start the game as well as your keyboard during the game. Once a word is displayed, you will then guess the word by using letters on your keyboard. Ex. "Insane".

Scoring

Every time you get a letter wrong, a stick will appear. The more you get the letters wrong, the more sticks you will have. Once those sticks become a man, you lose. 

Limitations

There are only a certain amount of words that are allowed the be used while play Hangman.
