SNOWFALL


Objective

Snowfall is a single player game where your main objective is to avoid the falling snowfall with your mouse.

Mechanics

Mouse will be needed to start the game as during the game. That's basically all the controls except when you need to look at instructions or when you restart

Scoring

Every time you avoid a snowflake, you gain one point. There will be three levels, with every level increasing it's snowflake drop. Each level will go up to 20, and if you pass level 3, you win.

Limitations

Limited mouse movement and random snowflake drop.
